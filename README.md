##### Notes

*   **EleksTube IPS Clock** is the original model created by the inventor in 2021. There are now many similar designs and clones on the market with varying hardware modifications.
    
*   All "Original EleksTube" clocks sold after July 2022 are "Gen2" versions. Refer to the [Blog post on EleksTube website](https://elekstube.com/blogs/news/instructions-on-elekstube-clock-for-gen2-systems) for more details.
    
*   Newer versions from EleksTube, such as PR1 and PR2, Pro and special editions (Pink etc.), are based on the base Gen2 version and sometimes called Gen3, because the original firmware version is already at Version 3.x for them.
    
*   The "basic" version is now officially called "**EleksTube IPS Classic Edition**"
    
*   In 2024, the IPSTUBE clocks became the cheapest and most widely available "clone" variant of the EleksTube clocks on the market. They are offered by a wide range of sellers and under many different names, but they all have the "IPSTUBE" logo printed on the front. Most listings include words like Nixie, Tube, Clock, LED, Light, RGB, IPS, and Glow in the description.
    

### 1.3 Purchasing Information

You can buy the "EleksTube IPS Clock" (or its clones) from eBay, Banggood, AliExpress, Amazon, the EleksTube website and other retailers.

Ensure the seller has a good reputation and offers a kind of return guarantee to avoid purchasing fake products or being tricked.

### 1.4 Firmware Compatibility

*   This firmware supports and has been tested on various clock models listed above.
    
*   If you discover a new clone or version of these types of clocks, please report it by creating an issue in the "Issues" section of the GitHub project. Provide as many details as possible to help expand compatibility.

Note: See "Known problems/Limitations" for more info.

## 4\. Quick Start - Backup and Pre-Build firmware images

Backup your original firmware and use the pre-built firmware to start with this custom firmware.

### 4.1 Backup first!!!

**Always backup YOUR clocks firmware version as a first step!**

If you mess-up your clock, it's only your fault!

**Note**: **Backup images from other users** normally **DO NOT WORK** as the most original firmware (like from EleksTube) is locked to the MAC address of the ESP32!

For other clocks it MAY work, but don't assume it! Most clocks have MAC address binding!

So again: Do a backup of your original firmware first!

### 4.2 How to do the backup

#### 1) Install the USB Serial Port Device Driver

##### Windows

*   On Windows, plug-in the cable into the clock and connect it to an USB port of your PC. Then run Windows Update. It will find and install the driver and generate an virtual COM port.  
    Windows device manager COM port example:  
    ![Windows device manager COM port example](/documentation/ImagesMD/WindowsDeviceManagerCOMport.png)
    
*   Only if Windows Update is not working for you, visit the Chinese manufacturer's website for newest [CH340 driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html) for Windows and install them manually.
    

##### Linux

*   On an up-to-date Linux it works out of the box. COM port should be something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
    
*   If it is not working, see this [tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/linux) and see the Chinese manufacturer's website for newest [CH340 driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html) for Linux.
    

#### 2) Save your original firmware

To read from (or write to) the clock, it needs to be in the "download mode". Most clocks will go into this mode automatically, when the ESPTool tries to read or write to them. Some clocks needs a button pressed while the powering phase (plugging the USB cable), like the IPSTUBEs.

##### Windows users:

*   In the folder `pre-built-firmware` of this repo you have the `esptool.exe`, which is used to talk to the ESP32 in your clock over the USB-Serial chip on the board of the clock.
    
*   Open Device Manager and find out which virtual COM port represents your clock.
    
*   Modify file `_ESP32 save flash 4MB.cmd` with your COM port number (or 8MB version for the IPSTUBEs).
    
*   Run the CMD file.
    
*   It will generate a file named `backup1.bin`. Rename it and save it to a safe place!
    
*   This is your precious backup!
    

##### Linux users:

*   You probably already know where to get `ESPTool` and how to use it. :)
    
*   If not, this guide from the Tasmota project is very easy to follow: [ESPTool](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Esptool/#put-device-in-firmware-upload-mode)
    
*   Adopt the settings for your connected clock and save the firmware file to your device.
    

### 4.3 Use the pre-builded firmware images

If you just want to use this firmware without setting up the development tools and libraries and everything, navigate to folder `\pre-built-firmware\` and modify `_ESP32 write flash.cmd` to upload the version for your clock.

More info can be found in the `\pre-built-firmware\` folder in the [README.MD](pre-built-firmware/README.md). Like:

*   Features enabled in the images
    
*   How to get the newest image
    

If you want more features and configure the firmware, continue reading and check section "How to build this firmware".

### 4.4 Restore backup

You can write back your original firmware by modyfing the file `_ESP32 write flash.cmd`.

*   Set correct COM port and the name of your firmware backup file
    
*   If needed, set the size to be written
    
*   Run the CMD file and flash the firmware file
    
*   Check if clock is working
    

### 4.5 Known backup problems

#### COM port problems

There are a lot of possible issues known with so called "virtual COM ports". Some common ones are listed below.

*   On Windows: No COM port at all, but "unknown device" in the device manager -> Try to install the CH340 drivers manually.
    
*   ESPTool fails to read or write all of the firmware -> Check your cable and if possible try another and a shorter one. Try to reduce the baud rate of the connection (like to 115200 or even below). Try to use an external powered USB hub, to avoid under powering.
    
*   ESPTool is giving an error like "device is not in the download mode" -> Try to hold the power button while plugging the USB-C (power) cable. If this doesn't help, you may have a timing problem with the USB-UART chip. This is known for some combinations of USB controllers (especially 3.x) and the CH340. Try to use a USB2.x HUB with external USB power supply or get another COM-port card. If nothing helps, try to use another computer.
    

For more info ask your favorite search engine or AI Chatbot :)

### 4.6 Lost firmware file

If you lost your orginal firmware file and wants to restore the orginal firmware you normaly have a problem, because even if you get a backup file from another user, it is locked to the MAC address of the other ESP32 MAC. Under some conditions, it should be possible to change the encoded MAC address in the firmware. This worked for EleksTube Gen1 clocks. See [Issue 8](https://github.com/aly-fly/EleksTubeHAX/issues/8).

Note: There is no guarantee, that you are able to change the MAC address in the firmware file successfully! If the original manufacturer decides to encode the MAC address or hide it, the described method will not work!

So remember: **Always backup your original firmware!**

## 5\. How to build this firmware

Unfortunately, it's not simple plug-and-play. You need to do some things.

These instructions assume you already know how to use the **Visual Studio Code** and the **PlatformIO IDE** extension for it, and just need to know what to do.

### 5.1 Download the code

You're either reading this file after downloading/cloning it already, or you're reading it on GitHub.

If the last point applies, then we assume you can figure out how to get the code from GitHub and put it somewhere on your local machine.

### 5.2 Visual Studio Code & PlatformIO IDE

Follow this guide here: [Install PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

In short:

*   Download, install and run VSCode
    
*   Go to Extensions, search for "PlatformIO IDE" and install it (it will take a while - observe status messages in the bottom right corner). If you don't have Python already installed it will be automatically added by PlatformIO. In case of issues, install Python 3.x manually.
    

### 5.3 Open the project in Visual Studio Code/PlatformIO

*   Start Visual Studio Code (VSC) and select "Open Folder".
    
*   Select the `EleksTubeHAX_pio` folder from your location of the code of this project.
    
*   PlatformIO (PIO) will detect the `platformio.ini` file and open the project as an PlatformIO project automatically and will download all needed packages/libraries.
    
*   If this is not happening automatilly, go to the PIO tab in VSC and select "Pick a Folder" and select the `EleksTubeHAX_pio` folder.

#### 5.3.1 ESP32 platform support

The EspressIF 32 development platform for PlatformIO is required to support the ESP32 microcontroller. It will be installed automatically when this project is opened in VSCode/PlatformIO or if the first build is triggered. It will take a while - observe status messages in the bottom right corner.

Tested on version 6.0.10 from the [PlatformIO registry](https://registry.platformio.org/platforms/platformio/espressif32).

It is possible that the project also works with ESP32 platform modules from other sources (like Tasmota), but it is not recommended!

#### 5.3.2 PIO build environment

The default PIO environment for this project is namend "EleksTubeHax" using the board definition of the orginal "Espressif ESP32 Dev Module" named "esp32dev". The IPSTUBE needs to use the "EleksTubeHax8MB" environment with a custom board definition ("Espressif ESP32 Dev Module 8MB") named esp32dev8MB.

Flash partition size settings are already configured in the following files.

| filename | environment | flash size | app part size | data part size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `partition_noOta_1Mapp_3Mspiffs.csv` | EleksTubeHax | 4.0 MB | 1.2 MB | 2.8 MB |
| `partition_noOta_1Mapp_7Mspiffs.csv` | EleksTubeHax8MB | 8.0 MB | 1.2 MB | 6.8 MB |

No OTA partition, one app partition, one data partition as SPIFFS to store the images of the clock faces.

These files are used by PlatformIO to create the partions on the flash of the ESP32 when uploading.

Upload port is set to 921600 baud in the `platformio.ini` file.

**Note**: Some clocks do not support such high speed, if you have issues, reduce this to 512000 baud or even lower.

#### 5.3.3 Libraries in use

All external libraries in use (for details, see the `platformio.ini` file) are automatically installed from the [PlatformIO registry](https://registry.platformio.org) (or their specified source locations). Since no fixed version numbers are set by default in `platformio.ini`, the **most recent versions** are fetched when the project is first opened or before the initial compilation.

* The initial installation may take some time - monitor status messages in the build log screen to see the progress.

* Standard libraries from the frameworks (espressif32 + arduino) are not explicitly listed.

##### 5.3.3.1 Verified Working Versions (as of 2025-05-18)

The project compiles and runs correctly with the library versions listed below. Newer (and possibly older) versions should also work.

If you encounter issues with automatic installation, refer to the comments in `platformio.ini` for troubleshooting.

**Notes**:
`makuna/RTC` is only required for "SI HAI clock".

##### 5.3.3.3 Library Code Used

Code from `dushyantahuja/IPGeolocation` and `arduino-libraries/NTPClient` libraries were copied into the project and heavily updated (mostly bug fixes and error-catching).

Original libraries:

| Library | Author | Latest version | Source Code Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| arduino-libraries/NTPClient | Arduino Libraries | 3.2.1 | [https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient) |
| dushyantahuja/IPGeolocation | Dushyant Ahuja | 3.0.0 | [https://github.com/dushyantahuja/IPGeolocation](https://github.com/dushyantahuja/IPGeolocation) |

##### 5.3.3.4 Modified Libraries

Some libraries require modifications to work with the specific clock hardware or to implement required functionality.  
The modified versions are stored in the `lib` directory of the `EleksTubeHAX_pio` project.

| Library | Author | Latest Version | Source Code Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sparkfun/SparkFun APDS9960 RGB and Gesture Sensor | SparkFun | 1.4.3 | [https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun\_APDS-9960\_Sensor\_Arduino\_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_APDS-9960_Sensor_Arduino_Library) |
| (not listed in PIO registry) | Marcin Saj | 1.0.7 | [https://github.com/marcinsaj/RTC_RX8025T](https://github.com/marcinsaj/RTC_RX8025T) |

**Note:** The modified version of the `SparkFun APDS-9960` library is only required for the NovelLife SE clock (which includes a gesture sensor). It is always compiled **but not linked** for other clock variants.

#### 5.3.4 Configure the `TFT_eSPI` library

The supplied `script_configure_tft_lib.py` automatically takes care of the library configuration. It copies two files (`_USER_DEFINES.h` and `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h`) into the `TFT_eSPI` library folder before building. This makes sure, that the TFT\_eSPI library is initalized with the correct values for each clock type.

If you have issues with the scripts, copy the files manually every time the `TFT_eSPI` library is updated.

#### 5.3.5 Configure the `APDS9960` library (for NovelLife SE)

The supplied `script_adjust_gesture_sensor_lib.py` modifies some files of the APDS9960 library before building. It adds the support for the ID of the used (cloned) gesture chip (needed for NovelLife SE with gesture sensor only).

### 5.4 Configure, Build and Upload new firmware

Make sure you configured everything for your clock in the `_USER_DEFINES.h` in the `src` folder:

*   Rename/Copy `_USER_DEFINES - empty.h` to `_USER_DEFINES.h`
    
*   Select the target hardware platform (Elekstube, Elekstube Gen 2, NovelLife, SI\_HAI or PunkCyber, IPSTUBE) by uncommenting the appropriate hardware define (only ONE clock type can be defined at a time, so comment out the unwanted)
    
*   Select if you prefer WPS or hardcoded credentials for WiFi (comment '#define WIFI\_USE\_WPS' line and enter your WiFi network credentials to the other lines and uncomment them)
    
*   Select image type for the clock faces to store: Bitmap files (.BMP) or .CLK files (uncomment #define USE\_CLK\_FILES)
    

Optionally:

*   Enable automatic "Night Time Mode" by (uncomment `#define DIMMING` line and also the follwing which defines the begin and end of the night time).
    
*   Enable integrated MQTT service (uncomment `#define MQTT_PLAIN_ENABLED` line and enter your MQTT credentials. From your local broker or from an internet-based broker. E.g. register on [SmartNest.cz](https://www.smartnest.cz/), create a Thermostat device, copy your username, API key and Thermostat Device ID.
    
*   Enable Home Assistant (HA) support by uncomment `#define MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` and the following block of comments for Auto-Discovery in HA (local MQTT Broker is required).
    
*   NOTE: Only one MQTT service can be used at once.
    
*   Use IP-based geolocation by Abstract (uncomment `#define GEOLOCATION_ENABLED` and enter your geolocation API key: Register on [Abstract API](https://www.abstractapi.com/), select Geolocation API and copy your API key.
    

Connect the clock to your computer via a USB cable. You'll see, that a new serial port is detected and showing up in the device configuration. If not, check the section "Install the USB Serial Port Device Driver".

PlatformIO will automatically select the right port for uploading (in most cases).

Most clocks will go into to the download mode automatically, when PlatformIO is trying to upload the built firmware files. Some clocks needs a button pressed while the powering phase (plugging the USB cable), like the IPSTUBEs.

**Note**: If you have Bluetooth virtual ports on your machine, it might hang and you must manually select the COM port in the `platformio.ini`, see [Upload options](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/upload/index.html).

#### 5.4.1 Step 1 - Compile the code and upload the firmware file (to the app partition)

Compile the code via the "Build" command of PlatformIO extension and upload the code via the "Upload" command in the matching environment for your clock.

![PlatformIO Build](/documentation/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuild.png)

At this point, it should build cleanly and upload successfully.

Example output from a successful build:

![PlatformIO Build Output](/documentation/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuildOutput.png)

Example output from a successful upload:

![PlatformIO Upload Output](/documentation/ImagesMD/PlatformIOUploadOutput.png)

Note: For IPSTUBE clocks use "EleksTubeHax8MB" environment

**Note**: On auto-reset clocks, you'll see the clock boot up after upload. It will go into the setup routine and ask for WPS or connecting to the configured WiFi network. On some clocks, you need to to a manual reset (power off/on cylce)

**Note**: After the initially flash, your clock will **NOT SHOW ANYTHING** on the displays after the setup phase! This is, because it doesn't have any bitmaps to display on the flash memory yet!

**The screens will stay blank until you upload data!**

Continue with the next step to get the clock running.

#### 5.4.2 Step 2 - Fill data partition (SPIFFS) with images

The repository comes with a "predefined" set of BMP files in the `data` subdirectory of the `EleksTubeHAX_pio` folder.

Each set of 10 images (one image for each digit) is called a "clock face" and can be chosen from the clock menu. Each set represents normally a different design or 'font' for the clock. See below if you want to make your own.

Note: All files in the `data` directory will be packed into the SPIFFS flash image! Make sure to tidy it up. Only the necessary images should be there and `clockfaces.txt` with names of the clock fonts (for HA.

##### 5.4.2.1 Generate and upload

*   In PlatformIO extension go to "Project Tasks" and expand: EleksTubeHax -> Platform
    
*   Select "Build Filesystem Image" first
    
*   Then connect the clock in download mode
    
*   Click "Upload Filesystem Image"
    

![PlatformIO Build Filesystem](/documentation/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuildFilesystem.png)

This will upload the files to the SPIFFS filesystem on the ESP32 (flash of the clock).

Note: The data will stay there, even if you re-upload the real firmware to the app partition, because the data partition is not overriden or modified by that.

Note: For IPSTUBE clocks use "EleksTubeHax8MB" environment

### 5.4.3 Check if clock is working

After Step 2 the clock should boot up and show the boot sequence on all displays. After finishing the boot sequence, the clock should display the actual time with the default clock face.

## 5.5 Create a flashable firmware image

Alternatively to build and uploading the app part and the data part in single steps, you can create a single firmware file, which is flashable all at once to the clock.

You still need to define all the settings/features you want to use in the `USER_DEFINES.h`, especially your clock type.

Additionally, you need to uncomment the line `-D CREATE_FIRMWAREFILE` in the platformio.ini to enable a post-build step, to create the image for your clock.

If you now build the project in PlatformIO via the "Build" command, the normal build will takes place and afterwards, a helper script will call the build for the SPIFFS data partition and then merge the existing single files together to one file.

The output file is written to the default output dir of the build. Usually the subfolder `.pio\build\EleksTubeHax\` in the project folder (or `.pio\build\EleksTubeHax8MB`).

The firmware file will be named like `<CLOCKNAME>_combined.bin` (e.g. Elekstube\_CLOCK\_Gen2\_combined.bin).

This file can be flashed with the `esptool.exe` with the `write_flash` option.

E.g. assuming you are using the `esptool.exe` in the pre-build-firmware folder:

`esptool.exe --chip esp32 --port COM5 --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash 0x0000 ..\EleksTubeHAX_pio\.pio\build\EleksTubeHax\Elekstube_CLOCK_Gen2_combined.bin --erase-all`

### 5.5.1 Helper script

The supplied `script_build_fs_and_merge.py` automatically hangs in two more post-build steps to the build process of PlatformIO (PIO).

The first one executes PlatformIO with the build target `buildfs` (equivalent to the option "Build Filesystem Image" in the PIO GUI) by calling PIO directly from Python. The file `spiffs.bin` with the data partition is created in the PIO build target directory.

The second one checks if all necessary files are present and then reads the used partition table file for this PIO environment to get the right offsets for merging the files togehter.

It then uses the `esptool.py` with the option `merge_bin` to merge the binary files together.

## 5.6 Miscellaneous stuff

### 5.6.1 Custom clock faces from Bitmaps

If you want to change the uploaded clock faces for the clock:

*   Create your own set of BMP files or select and copy some from the provided sets in the `data - other graphics` folder of this repo or download some from the internet (see below).
    
*   Maximum resolution of each image is 135 x 240 pixels (HxW). They can be smaller, then the picture will be centered on the display.
    
*   Maximum color depth is 24 bit RGB. But recommended is palettized Bitmaps with 256 colors palette.
    
*   Name them `10.bmp` (for digit Zero) through `19.bmp` (for digit Nine); `20.bmp` to `29.bmp`, and so on. Note: There is no set 00-09.bmp!
    
*   You can add max 8 clock face sets in the moment (Due to a problem in the detection meachanism).
    
*   If needed, rename the generated files and put them in the `data` directory.
    
*   Then do the "Build Filesystem Image & Upload Filesystem Image" dance again.
    

Tips:

*   Cut away any black border, this only eats away valuable flash storage space! Keep the same height for all images!
    
*   Run your preferred image editor and play with reduced bit depths / palettization and dither of the image!
    
*   Very good results are with Dithering and 256-color palette. Size reduction is approx 70%.
    
*   With very simple images (like 7-segment digits) even 16-color (4-bit) palette is enough and reduces size even further.
    

### 5.6.2 CLK files as alternative

Before supporting palettized Bitmaps, there was a special format used to store images, to safe some space on the flash of the clock. You can still switch to use CLK (Clock) files only, but there is no space saving anymore, if palattized Bitmaps are used!

To convert existing image files to CLK format:

*   Run the tool `\Prepare_images\Convert_BMP_to_CLK.exe` (Windows only)
    
*   You can select all BMP files to be converted at once. It will create CLK files from it.
    
*   For a 24 bit depth Bitmap, size reduction is approx 30%.
    
*   If needed, rename the generated files and put them in the `data` directory.
    
*   Then do the "Build Filesystem Image & Upload Filesystem Image" dance again.
    

Note: It is either Bitmap or CLK! No mixing, so make sure to "clean" the `data` folder before switching.

#### 5.6.3 Download Clock faces

If you have your own clock face that'll work and want it listed here, please file an Issue and/or Pull Request.

#### 5.6.4 Configure your WiFi network

*   For WPS: When prompted by the clock, press WPS button on your router (or in web-interface of your router). Clock will automatically connect to the WiFi and save data for future use. No need to input your credentials anywhere in the source code. The clock will remember WiFi connection details even if you unplug the clock.
    
*   Without WPS: Add your WiFi credentials into `_USER_DEFINES.h` file before building the firmware.
    

Note: The `_USER_DEFINES.h` is included in the default `.gitignore` file, so that your personal credentials will not be pushed to a git repo by default, if you are using a forked git repo.

### 5.6.5 MQTT and Home Assistant

#### 5.6.5.1 Home Assistant

##### 5.6.5.1.1 Setup

If you want to integrate the clock into your Home Assistant, you need to make sure, that Home Assistant and the clock uses the same MQTT broker.

Normally you will already have a MQTT broker running locally, which supports the HA discovery and communication messages, like Mosquitto. If not done already, you can set it up easily via an Add-On in HA. See: [Home Assistant MQTT Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/)

You can also use an internet-based broker which supports "Home Assistant messages" (topics) for discovery and communication, like HiveMQ.

Enable the `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` define to have HA support and the belonging `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT_*` defines for auto discovery via the MQTT integration.

After you set up the broker, you need to enter the used IP, port, username and password of it into the matching `MQTT_*` defines in your `_USER_DEFINES.h` (MQTT config section).

After flashing the firmware, the clock will first try connect to the WiFi and then to the given MQTT broker. Check the displays, if a 'NO MQTT' message appears under one of the digits, then the connection was NOT successful and you need to debug why. Hint: use a switch `#define DEBUG_OUTPUT_MQTT` to get detailed debug messages on the serial port of the clock.

If the connection was successful the clock sends the discovery messages for HA and the device should be visible in the MQTT integration.

Note: If you change your used clock faces in the data folder, the `clockfaces.txt` in the `data` folder needs to be changed too. This is, because the shown names in HA for the clock faces under "Main light" are hard coded and read from there.

Note: `#define MQTT_CLIENT` is used as a unique device name (i.e. it should be different if you have several IPS clocks) and is the "root" part of the topic for all entities that will be interacted with via MQTT.

Note: If you want to use an internet-based broker, you can use HiveMQ. You will need to create an account there and set it up in HA and in here. 'MQTT\_USE\_TLS' must be defined, because HiveMQ only supports encrypted connections. The HiveMQ TLS cert is based on the root CA of Let's Encrypt, so you also need to copy the 'mqtt-ca-root.pem' file from the 'data - other graphics' folder into the 'data' folder of the PIO project and upload the data partition (file system) with the changed app partition. Other brokers or your locally used cert for your MQTT broker may need another root CA to be set. See: [Connect HA to HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/connect-home-assistant-to-hivemq-cloud/)

##### 5.6.4.1.2 Used integrations

Interactions between the firmware of the clock and Home Assistant is done like descriped in the MQTT integration documentations (see below).

By default, the clock sends auto-discovery messages, and all its entities will be detected by the MQTT integration without user intervention.

The clock is discoverd as two lights (Main and Back) and some other entities (i.e. a switch) as Configuration. The last one is needed to be able to switch the settings of the clock.

See the HA MQTT documentation for details of the used MQTT integrations:

*   [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery)
    
*   [MQTT Light integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.mqtt/)
    
*   [MQTT Switch integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch.mqtt/)
    
*   [MQTT Number integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/number.mqtt/)
    

##### 5.6.4.1.3 Usage

After a successful auto discovery, you will find a new device under "Setting -> Devices and Services -> MQTT -> XX devices", named like your `MQTT_CLIENT` define.

![HA MQTT Integration Overview](/documentation/ImagesMD/HAMQTTIntegrationOverview.png)

If you go into the device details it should look like this:

![HA MQTT Integration Details](/documentation/ImagesMD/HAMQTTIntegrationDetails.png)

You can now use this device on your HA dashboards.

The main light represents the displays of the clock, the back light the LED ambient lights.

Each one is dimmable, can be turned on and off and for the 'main light', the clock faces are switchable via "Effect".

![HA MQTT Main Light Details](/documentation/ImagesMD/HAMQTTMainLightDetails.png)

For the 'back light', the LED colour and mode can be set.

![HA MQTT Back Light Details](/documentation/ImagesMD/HAMQTTBackLightDetails.png)

The settings for the LED modes and the general clock settings can only be set from the "Configuration" entity.

#### 5.6.5.2 MQTT without Home Assistant

##### 5.6.5.2.1 Setup

If the `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` is not enabled, but `MQTT_PLAIN_ENABLED` is, the MQTT support is limited. This is mostly intended to work with [SmartNest.cz](https://www.smartnest.cz/) service, which is a simple user interface. It can be extended / integrated with Google assistant, Alexa or SmartThings.

The actual MQTT implementation is reacting to control commands of an emulated temperature controller, so you can use the temperature setpoint to change clock faces and on/off function to control the clock.

You will need to create an account, set up the device there and get the ID; and fill in the data into the matching `MQTT_*` defines in your `_USER_DEFINES.h` (MQTT config section).

Note: If you want to use encrypted connection to your broker, you need to enable 'MQTT\_USE\_TLS' and copy a valid root CA cert file to the 'data' folder. See the notes under the HA section for HiveMQ above.

#### 5.6.5.3 Debugging MQTT

Further analysis or debugging problems with the MQTT code is easier to perform using a MQTT message reader tool, for example, "MQTT Explorer", a common HA Add-On for users, who prefer manual configuration. See [HA forum post for MQTT Explorer Add-On](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/addon-mqtt-explorer-new-version/603739).

Note: It can be also used as a stand-alone application. See [Homepage of MQTT Explorer project](https://mqtt-explorer.com/).

You need to connect to the same MQTT broker like the clock and then will be able to see the messages from the clock and send them.

All MQTT messages from and to the clock are also traced out via the serial interface. So using a serial monitor while using the clock, gives also debug information. Make sure you enable the `DEBUG_OUTPUT_MQTT` before compilation and upload.

## 6\. Known problems/limitations

##### 6.1 No RTC backup battery for SI HAI IPS Clock

There is no battery on the SI HAI IPS clock, so the clock will loose the time, if powered off.

##### 6.2 Precision of the gesture sensor (NovelLife SE)

The accuracy of the gesture sensor on the Novellife clock is not very good. It needs some 'training' to be able to control the clock.

The defined gestures and there button equivalents are:

| gesture | button |
| --- | --- |
| down, near | Power |
| up, far | Mode |
| left | Left |
| right | Right |

*   The movement of the finger/hand from behind the glass tubes of the watch, over the glass tubes, directly and closely over the sensor to the front of the watch is the “down” gesture.
    
*   The movement of the finger/hand from in front of the watch, directly and closely over the sensor, further over the glass tubes and behind it is the “up” gesture.
    
*   The movement of the finger/hand starting left side from the sensor and moving over the sensor to the right side is the “right” gesture.
    
*   The movement of the finger/hand starting right side from the sensor and moving over the sensor to the left side is the “left” gesture.
    
*   Moving the finger/hand from directly above the sensor (from 5-8 cm away) toward the sensor (up to about 1 cm away) is the “near” gesture.
    
*   Moving from close by the sensor (coming from the front and putting the finger/hand in 1cm distance over the sensor) to a bit more far away (5-7cm distance) is the "far" gesture.
    

##### 6.3 One button menu for IPSTUBE clocks

The IPSTUBE clocks have only one button, so there are some limitations at the moment.

*   Short pressing the button brings up the menu.
    
*   Short pressing while in the menu changes the menu scope (next menu point).
    
*   Long pressing (at least 0.5 seconds) changes the value of the currently selected menu scope.
    

This makes navigating through the menus a bit "unhandy." The values always change "to the right" because the long button press emulates a "right button" press in the menu. This limits the selection of values (e.g., for the absolute color values). The selection loops back to the first value after reaching the last value.

##### 6.4 No real display turn-off or dimming for some IPSTUBE clocks

Depending on the board version (PCB revision) of the IPSTUBE models (H401 and H402), transistor Q1 may or may not be present on the board.

*   If the transistor is present, the displays can be fully turned on and off like on other clocks, and hardware dimming is possible.
    
*   If the transistor is not present, the TFT LCDs cannot be turned on or off via software without modifying the hardware. Only software dimming (alpha blending) is available.
    

It seems that only the early versions of the clocks lack the transistor. All versions seen after mid-2024 appear to have it.

By default, the code assumes that the transistor is present and that the displays are dimmable. This will not damage your clock, even if the transistor is missing, but display dimming will be completely disabled!

If the dimming is not working with your clock, you need to comment the line `#define DIM_WITH_ENABLE_PIN_PWM` in the `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h` and rebuild and upload the firmware.

See also the code comments for more info in the `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h` for the IPSTUBEs.

#### 6.5 LED strip on the bottom for some IPSTUBE clocks

Some versions of the IPSTUBEs have a LED stripe with 28 RGB LEDs installed on the bottom.

*   The strip extends the six LEDs at the bottom of the LCDs, known as the "backlight".
    
*   Currently, the strip follows the backlight configuration (modes, colors, etc.).
    
*   All models have a 3-pin socket on the board, so theoretically, the strip can be retrofitted using any WS2812B-based LED strip with some modifications. However, the recess in the metal cover is missing, preventing the light from shining through.
    
*   By default, only six LEDs are set. To enable the full LED strip, change the value of `NUM_BACKLIGHT_LEDS` to `34` in `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h`.

## 8\. Hardware modifications

#### 8.1 PunkCyber IPS clock: No CH340 chip soldered on PCB of newer editions

##### Problem

**Short story**: CH340 chip is missing.

**Long story**: The original version of the "PunkCyber IPS Clock" was buyable from PCBWay as "RGB Glow Tube DIY Clock" and is no longer available from there (see [PCBWay | RGB Glow Clock](https://www.pcbway.com/project/gifts_detail/RGB_Glow_Tube_Clock_907ad35c.html)). This version had a CH340 chip soldered and two USB-C ports, where the right one was working, to communicate with a PC via the USB-UART chip.

The clock is still available to buy from other resellers. It is already assembled and in a box, sold as "PunkCyber IPS Clock".

All these newer versions of the clock do NOT have the CH340 chip and the components for the "auto download mode circuit" soldered! Just empty soldering header. So both USB-C ports are only for giving power to the clock.

A communication (like downloading or uploading firmware) is not possible easily without this chip!

The original manufacturer has an 'interesting' way to update the firmware "over-the-air", by connecting your mobile phone to the Wifi-Access-Point of the clock and joining a WeChat channel and let them control the clock from there (see the discussion on the PCBWay site).

##### Solution

If you want to bring the EleksTubeHAX firmware to the clock, we need either to solder a CH340 chip and the transistors and resistors on there designated places, or use an "external" USB-UART bridge/board.

Below the missing chip are some soldering headers:

![PunkCyber / RGB Glow tube](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_PCB_CH340_header.jpg)

##### Way 1 - External UART-USB adapter

The "easiser" way is the external board solution IMO.

BOOT is connected to GPIO0 (pin 25) on the ESP32 EN is connected to EN (pin 3) on the ESP32 G is connected to Ground (pins 1/38/15) on the ESP32 R is connected to GPIO1 / TxD (pin 35) on the ESP32 T is connected to GPIO3 / RxD (pin 34) on the ESP32

So we just need to connect G on the PCB to Ground on the UART bridge/board R on the PCB to Rx on the UART bridge/board T on the PCB to Tx on the UART bridge/board

| Pin PCB | Pin UART |
| --- | --- |
| G | GND |
| R | Rx |
| T | Tx |

We also need a way to put the clock into the download mode, so we need some kind of a switch between left header of BOOT 1 (to ESP32) and right header of BOOT 1 (Ground).

Best way is to solder "sockets" to the existing headers, so that there longer pin side is pointing downwards from the not printed side of the PCB. Reason is easy, there is enough space between the backplate and the PCB to leave them soldered on for re-usage and they are not visible from the upper side.

Soldered sockets:

![soldered sockets with backplate](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_soldered_sockets.jpg)

Soldered sockets with backplate:

![soldered sockets with backplate](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_soldered_sockets_with_backplate.jpg)

BOOT needs to be shorted, while the USB-C cable is connected to one of the USB-C ports (while powering) and then released to go into the download mode.

Normally, all USB-UART bridges/boards should work, but for me, the UART bridge mode of the Flipper Zero (STM chip) didn't work properly! I have no idea why.

So I successfully used an old FT232 board, which was still flying around (with Mini-USB :)) to read/backup the orginal firmware and write the EleksTubeHAX version.

To get one on your own, search for "USB to UART" on your favorite seller platform, like the ones with A from US or PRC. Costs should not exceed 2-7 EUR/USD.

Working solution:

![PunkCyber connected via FT232](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_connected_UART-USB_bridge_and_reset_button.jpg)

Successful backup:

![PunkCyber successfull backup](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_backup_successful.jpg)

Thanks to @Fastdruid for finding a good way to overcome this problem! (see [Issue 62](https://github.com/aly-fly/EleksTubeHAX/issues/62))

##### Way 2 - Buy Missing Components and Solder Them

**Components needed:**

* 1× CH340C chip (SOP-16 package) - USB to UART converter
* 2× 10k Ohm SMD resistors (0805 format) - for auto-download circuit
* 2× 8050 transistors (SOT-23 package) - for auto-download circuit
* 1× 4.7nF SMD capacitor (50V - 0805 format) - decoupling capacitor

![PunkCyber Missing Components](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_PCB_CH340_components.jpg)

**Soldering notes:**

* All components are surface-mount (SMD) devices
* Recommended tools:
  * Solder paste
  * Hot air soldering station
* It is possible to solder these few components with a normal soldering iron and wire, but I would not recommend it.

![PunkCyber Soldered Components](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_PCB_CH340_soldered.jpg)

When properly soldered, the clock will be recognized as a virtual COM port when connected via USB-C to your computer.

#### 8.2 EleksTube Gen1: 5V on CH340 and ESP32

##### Problem

The "Original Version" (Gen1) of the Elekstube clock has a few issues in the hardware design. Most notably, it forces 5V signals from the USB-UART chip into the ESP32, which is not happy about it. This is outside of the safe operating limits and significantly reduces the lifetime of the ESP32. Mine (from the original author) died because of this...

##### Solution

The CH340 chip, used for USB-UART conversion, can operate both on 5V and 3.3V. On the Gen1 board it is powered by 5V. We can switch it to 3.3V. Cut one trace on the bottom side of the board that supplies the chip with 5V and route the 3.3V over the resistors / capacitors to VDD and VREF of the CH340.

![EleksStube Gen1 hardware modification](/documentation/ImagesMD/EleksTube_IPS_CH340C_mod.jpg)

Note: This problem does not appear on Gen2 hardware from Elekstube! All clocks sold today (Autumn 2024) do not require any hardware modification!
